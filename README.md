Vibe Coding Tools - Vote! ❤️
🚀 Built my app landing page with Replit AI agent!

This project enables users to vote (like) their favorite coding tools, with clean data handling and user-specific tracking.

✨ Features
One Record Per User Per Tool
Ensures each user can only have one like record per tool for accurate data integrity.

Toggle Behavior
The liked column toggles between true and false whenever users click the heart icon.

Like Count Calculation
Displays the total likes for each tool by counting all records where liked = true.

User Isolation
Tracks each user's likes separately so multiple people can like the same tool independently.

This design tracks individual user preferences while maintaining accurate overall like counts for each tool.

🛠️ Tech Highlights
✅ Database Integration: Stored user interaction data in the VibeToolKit Database
✅ Google Sheets Integration: Collected submitted emails efficiently using Google Apps Script
✅ AI-Powered Development: Leveraged ChatGPT as my second assistant for troubleshooting
